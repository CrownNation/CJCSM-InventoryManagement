1. Run Migration
Run the migration either from Visual Studio (command found in Inventory_Context.cs) or by running the migration package on the server.

2. Run SQL Commands.
Run PipeDefinitionPropertiesInsertScript.sql first, which will insert all of the default fields for pipe properties.

OPTIONALLY:
Second, run TestDataInsertScript.sql if you want to insert test data into the database.
